Madlib C++ Code
===============

Current Ingredients:

1. Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL)
2. PostgreSQL port

To do:

- Failed boost assertions should become error messages and not abort the process
- "copy-on-non-const-initialization" semantics incomplete. We need some proper
  reference counting for AbstractHandles. Perhaps wrapping shared_ptr will
  already work
- Translate armadillo error messages into our own error messages
